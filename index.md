## About Me

I am a second year **direct PhD student** in the [**School of Electrical and Computer Engineering**](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) at [**Purdue Univesity**](https://www.purdue.edu/) advised by [**Prof. Christopher Brinton**](http://www.cbrinton.net/). 

I received my Bachelor's degree in [**Electrical and Electronics Engineering**](https://eee.nitk.ac.in/) from the [**National Institute of Technology Karnataka**](https://www.nitk.ac.in/) in 2015. My Bachelor's thesis focused on **"Supervised and Unsupervised Techniques for Image Segmentation"** advised by [**Prof. Ashvini Chaturvedi**](https://ece.nitk.ac.in/professor/ashvini-chaturvedi).

Prior to joining Purdue, I worked for a year as a **Research Scientist** at a California-based AI-solutions startup [**Foundation AI**](https://www.foundationai.com/) and for over 3 years as **Data Scientist** at a Bangalore-based healthcare startup [Practo](https://www.practo.com/). During my time in the industry, I have **built scalable ML solutions deployed in production** tackling real-world problems by leveraging advances in computer vision (CV), Natual Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (DL). The novel solutions I built also led to **academic publications**, specifically in the field of document classification and low-latency information retrieval (details listed in [**Experience**](/experience/) section).

## Research Interests
My current research lies in the intersection of **Representation Learning, Distributed Learning, and Optimization**. One of the main focus of my work is to design and analyse representation learning algorithms that are **scalable, communication-efficient, memory-efficient and robust to adversarial perturbations**.
