## About Me

I am an _AIML Resident_ (class of 2022) at Siri Speech, Apple ï£¿. My main research focus lies in the domains of _distributed (federated) learning of large scale (ASR) models_ addressing challenges related to data scarcity, data heterogeneity, privacy, personalization, and interpretability.

I graduated with a M.S (Thesis: ["Towards Privacy and Communication Efficiency in Distributed Representation Learning."](/publications#t1)) from the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE){:target="_blank"} specializing in _machine learning and artificial intelligence_ at [Purdue Univesity](https://www.purdue.edu/){:target="_blank"} advised by [Dr. Christopher Brinton](http://www.cbrinton.net/){:target="_blank"}. I have also had the opportunity of actively collaborating with [Dr. David Inouye](https://www.davidinouye.com){:target="_blank"}, [Dr. Qiang Qiu](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~qqiu/){:target="_blank"}, [Dr. Saurabh Bagchi](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~sbagchi/){:target="_blank"}, and [Dr. Seyyedali Hosseinalipour](https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/seyyedalihosseinalipour){:target="_blank"}.

<!--
I received my Bachelor's degree in [Electrical and Electronics Engineering](https://eee.nitk.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} from the [National Institute of Technology Karnataka](https://www.nitk.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} in 2015. My Bachelor's thesis focused on "Supervised and Unsupervised Techniques for Image Segmentation" advised by [Dr. Ashvini Chaturvedi](https://ece.nitk.ac.in/professor/ashvini-chaturvedi){:target="_blank"}. I also collaborated with [Dr. K Manjunatha Sharma](https://eee.nitk.ac.in/professor/KMS){:target="_blank"} on miniprojects to develop smart-switches using signal processing and ML techniques.

Prior to joining Purdue, I worked for a year as a Research Scientist at a California-based AI-solutions startup [Foundation AI](https://www.foundationai.com/){:target="_blank"} and for over 3 years as Data Scientist at a Bangalore-based healthcare startup [Practo](https://www.practo.com/){:target="_blank"}. During my time in the industry, I have built scalable ML solutions deployed in production tackling real-world problems by leveraging advances in computer vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (DL).

## Research Interests
My research interest lies at the intersection of _Representation Learning, Density Estimation, and Distributed Learning_. One of the main focuses of my work is to reduce the dependence on a  _large labeled dataset_ in model training by developing algorithms that are either predominantly  _unsupervised, self-supervised_ and/or _federated_ in nature. I also have an interest in the design and analysis of representation learning algorithms that are _scalable, communication-efficient, memory-efficient, and robust_ to adversarial perturbations. I have recently started exploring the role of deep reinforcement learning and its integration with unsupervised learning.
