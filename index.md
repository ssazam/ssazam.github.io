## About Me

I am a second year PhD student at **School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue Univesity** advised by **Prof. Christopher Brinton** and **Prof. Saurabh Bagchi**. 

My research focuses on deep learning of objective-driven representations.

Prior to this, I have worked for over **4 years as research scientist** solving problems in the field of healthcare and insurance (NLP: Document classification, OCR: specialized on-premise deployable models, Computer Vision: Cancer and Tuberculosis detection from Diagnostic Images).

I have received Bachelor's Degree from **National Institute of Technology Karnataka, India**. My Bachelor's thesis focuses on comparison of machine learning and classical techniques in "Image Segmentation", advised by Dr. Ashvini Chaturvedi.
