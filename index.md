## About Me

I am a third year M.S/Ph.D in the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE){:target="_blank"} specializing in _machine learning and artificial intelligence_ at [Purdue Univesity](https://www.purdue.edu/){:target="_blank"} advised by [Dr. Christopher Brinton](http://www.cbrinton.net/){:target="_blank"}. I have also had the opportunity of actively collaborating with [Dr. Qiang Qiu](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~qqiu/){:target="_blank"}, [Dr. Saurabh Bagchi](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~sbagchi/){:target="_blank"}, and [Dr. Seyyedali Hosseinalipour](https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/seyyedalihosseinalipour){:target="_blank"}.

I received my Bachelor's degree in [Electrical and Electronics Engineering](https://eee.nitk.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} from the [National Institute of Technology Karnataka](https://www.nitk.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} in 2015. My Bachelor's thesis focused on "Supervised and Unsupervised Techniques for Image Segmentation" advised by [Dr. Ashvini Chaturvedi](https://ece.nitk.ac.in/professor/ashvini-chaturvedi){:target="_blank"}. During my undergrad, I also collaborated with [Dr. K Manjunatha Sharma](https://eee.nitk.ac.in/professor/KMS){:target="_blank"} on several miniprojects to develop smart-switches using signal processing and ML techniques.

Prior to joining Purdue, I worked for a year as a Research Scientist at a California-based AI-solutions startup [Foundation AI](https://www.foundationai.com/){:target="_blank"} and for over 3 years as Data Scientist at a Bangalore-based healthcare startup [Practo](https://www.practo.com/){:target="_blank"}. During my time in the industry, I have built scalable ML solutions deployed in production tackling real-world problems by leveraging advances in computer vision (CV), Natual Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (DL). The novel solutions I built also led to academic publications, specifically in the field of document classification and low-latency information retrieval (details listed in [Experience](/experience/) section).

## Research Interests
My research interest lie at the intersection of _Representation Learning, Distributed Learning, and Optimization_. One of the main focus of my work is to reduce the dependence on _large labelled dataset_ in model training by developing algorithms that are predominantly of _unsupervised, self-supervised_. I also have an interest in the design and analyse representation learning algorithms that are _scalable, communication-efficient, memory-efficient and robust_ to adversarial perturbations. I have recently started treading the waters in deep reinforcement learning and it's integration with unsupervised learning. More on that soon!
